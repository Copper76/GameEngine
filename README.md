# ECS Game Engine

This project is a practice project to make a game engine using Entity-Component System, the graphics utilises GLFW library for rendering. The engine is called Fengshui at at the moment.

## Functions implemented
- [X] Create a simple snake game using pure SFML to learn the basics of input handling and rendering. It is implemented in the [Snake Branch](https://github.com/Copper76/GameEngine/tree/Snake)
- [X] Get Logging working with spdlog

## TODO
- [ ] Integrate GLFW into the ECS
- [ ] Create a entity component system structure
- [ ] Develop several components and entities, simple ones to start with such as simple data such as transform.
- [ ] Create the snake game with the game engine after its completion

## Deprecated Objectives
- [ ] Integrate SFML into the ECS

## Stretch Goal
- [ ] Integrate my physics engine into this game engine

## Requirement
- [sfml 2.6.1](https://github.com/SFML/SFML) (for snake game, deprecated)
- [glfw 3](https://glfw.org)
- [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog.git)
- [glad](https://glad.dav1d.de/)
- [imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui.git)
- [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm.git)
