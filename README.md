# ECS Game Engine

This project is a practice project to make a game engine using Entity-Component System, the graphics utilises GLFW library for rendering. The engine is called Fengshui at at the moment.

## Functions implemented
- [X] Create a simple snake game using pure SFML to learn the basics of input handling and rendering.

## TODO
- [ ] Create a entity component system structure
- [ ] Develop several components and entities, simple ones to start with such as simple data such as hp.
- [ ] Integrate GLFW into the ECS
- [ ] Get Logging working with spdlog

##Deprecated Objectives
- [ ] Integrate SFML into the ECS

## Stretch Goal
- [ ] Integrate my physics engine into this game engine

## Requirement
- SFML 2.6.1 (for snake game, deprecated)
- GLFW 3
- spdlog(currently not working)
